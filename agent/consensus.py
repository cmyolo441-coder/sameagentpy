"""Multi-model consensus — query several models and pick the best answer.

For high-stakes decisions (Goal Mode verification, code reviews, architecture
choices) it's valuable to ask N independent models and pick the response that
survives cross-checking. This module runs the same prompt against multiple
providers concurrently and applies a scoring/voting strategy.

Strategies:
  * ``first``       — return the fastest response (default, cheap)
  * ``majority``    — return the response most models agree on (semantic vote)
  * ``longest``     — return the most detailed response
  * ``scored``      — run a judge model to pick the best (most expensive)
